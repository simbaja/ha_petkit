## Alternatives

It looks like RobertD502 made a better integration (I found it after I started converting this one), see [his Github repository](https://github.com/RobertD502/home-assistant-petkit).  

**Since that integration does everything I wanted to do with these devices, I've discontinued development on this integration.  I've left it up in case it can be of some use to someone.**
